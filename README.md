## About me

* Pronouns: she/her
* Fun fact: I read a lot (often 30+ books/month) and tend to fall into new rabbit holes.

## 🎭 When I'm not coding, you can find me:

* 📖 Reading romantasy & self-growth
* 🎲 Playing board & card games (strategy > luck, most of the time)
* 🍳 Cooking & baking (I’m always testing “one small tweak”)
* 🚴‍♀️ Cycling and running (usually with a podcast)
* 🔍 Deep-diving into random topics and building tiny systems to organize what I learn
